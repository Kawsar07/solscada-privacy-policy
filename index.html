                <h2>2. User Roles and Access Permissions</h2>
                <p>SolScada uses a role-based access control system to manage user permissions. Your access to features and data depends on your assigned role:</p>
                
                <h3>2.1 User Role Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Super Admin:</strong> Full administrative access to all features, companies, and solar plants in the system</li>
                    <li><strong>Group Admin:</strong> Administrative access with permissions granted by Super Admin</li>
                    <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Company-level administrative access to specific assigned companies and their solar plants</li>
                    <li><strong>User:</strong> Limited access to view assigned solar plant data only</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Why We Use Role-Based Access Control</h3>
                <p>We implement different user roles for important security and operational reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication & Authorization:</strong> Ensures only authentic, authorized personnel can access solar plant data by requiring admin approval for all new users</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification Process:</strong> Admins and Super Admins verify the identity and legitimacy of users before granting access, preventing unauthorized individuals from viewing sensitive plant data</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Ensures users only access information relevant to their responsibilities, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Prevents unnecessary access to sensitive company and plant data by limiting visibility based on organizational hierarchy</li>
                    <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Allows companies to manage multiple solar plants with appropriate delegation of responsibilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Creates clear audit trails by tracking which users have access to specific data and features</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Company Support:</strong> Enables the system to serve multiple companies while keeping their data completely separate and secure</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Allows organizations to grow and add new users without compromising security or control</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Helps organizations meet data protection requirements by implementing principle of least privilege (users only access what they need)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 User Approval Process</h3>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>How User Accounts Are Created and Approved:</strong></p>
                    <p>SolScada requires administrator approval to ensure only authentic, authorized personnel gain access to solar plant monitoring data. Here's how the process works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1 - User Registration:</strong> A new user may register or be invited to the system</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2 - Admin Review:</strong> The user account enters a pending state and requires approval from an authorized administrator</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3 - Verification:</strong> Admin or Super Admin verifies the user's identity, legitimacy, and job role to ensure they are authentic personnel who should have access</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 4 - Approval or Rejection:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Approved:</strong> If the user is verified as authentic and authorized, the Admin/Super Admin approves the account and assigns appropriate permissions</li>
                                <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> If the user cannot be verified or is not authorized, the Admin/Super Admin rejects the account to protect system security</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 5 - Access Granted:</strong> Once approved, the user receives their assigned role (User, Admin, Group Admin) and can access only the data they are authorized to view</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Approval Wait Time:</strong> New users may need to wait for administrator approval before accessing the app. This wait time varies depending on admin availability but ensures that only verified, authentic personnel gain access to sensitive solar plant data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This approval process prevents unauthorized access, protects proprietary solar plant data, ensures compliance with security policies, and verifies that users are legitimate employees, contractors, or stakeholders of the solar plant owner.</p>

                        <strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT: USER ROLES ARE NOT PAID FEATURES</strong><br><br>
                        User roles exist ONLY for security, authentication, and organizational purposes. They are NOT monetization features:<br><br>

                        • Creating and managing users requires NO payment<br>
                        • The approval process is for security verification, NOT payment collection<br>
                        • Permission levels are based on job responsibilities and verification, NOT payment tiers<br>
                        • There is NO "premium" or "pro" version with more features<br>
                        • All features are available to all users based on their role needs<br>
                        • Admin approval ensures only authentic, authorized personnel access the system<br><br>
                        <strong>These roles protect your data privacy and security by verifying authentic users - they are NOT subscription levels!</strong>

                <h3>2.6 Data Visibility Based on Roles</h3>
                <p>Your role determines what information you can access:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Super Admin:</strong> Can view all companies, all solar plants, and all users across the entire system</li>
                    <li><strong>Group Admin:</strong> Can view assigned companies, their plants, and users within their scope</li>
                    <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Can only view their specific company's plants and users</li>
                    <li><strong>User:</strong> Can only view solar plants specifically assigned to them</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.7 Real-World Use Cases</h3>
                <p>Here are practical examples of how roles are used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example 1 - Solar Installation Company:</strong> A solar company installs plants for multiple clients. The company's Super Admin creates an Admin account for each client company. Each client Admin can then create User accounts for their own staff to monitor their plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example 2 - Corporate with Multiple Sites:</strong> A corporation has solar plants at 5 different locations. The corporate energy manager (Admin) creates User accounts for facility managers at each site, allowing them to monitor their specific location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example 3 - Multi-Company Management:</strong> An energy consulting firm manages solar installations for 10 different companies. A Group Admin can oversee all 10 companies, while each company has its own Admin managing their team.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>CRITICAL NOTE: All user roles and permissions are completely FREE.</strong> There are NO premium tiers, NO paid features, NO subscription plans to unlock additional access. These roles exist purely for security, privacy, and operational efficiency - NOT for monetization. Whether you are a Super Admin, Group Admin, Admin, or User, you pay absolutely nothing to use the app and its features.</p>
